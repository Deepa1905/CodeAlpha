# CodeAlphaa
This repository contains my internship projects with CodeAlpha.
It has three projects of web development-

**A) Temperature Converter:**
This project is designed to help users convert temperatures between three different scales: Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit.
It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are essential web development technologies.
Users can input a temperature value and select the scale they want to convert from and to. When they click a "Convert" button, the application calculates and displays the converted temperature in the chosen scale.
This kind of tool is practical for various scenarios, such as weather-related applications or scientific calculations.

**B) Background Generator:**
The Background Generator project focuses on changing the background color of a web page randomly when a "Change" button is clicked.
It's a simple yet fun project that can be used to create visually engaging and dynamic web pages.
JavaScript is likely used to generate random colors and apply them as the background of the page.
This project is a great way to learn how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) in web development and create interactive elements on a webpage.

**C) Landing Page:**
The Landing Page project appears to be an informational webpage about Uttarakhand, focusing on its beauty, culture, wildlife, and traditions.
It's constructed using HTML and CSS, which are fundamental technologies for building web pages.
Landing pages like this are often used to provide visitors with an introduction to a website or a specific topic.
HTML would be used to structure the content and layout of the page, while CSS would be used for styling and making the page visually appealing.
These projects demonstrate a good range of web development skills, including working with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. They cover both practical utility (temperature converter) and creative elements (background generator) while also showcasing your ability to create informative web content (landing page)
